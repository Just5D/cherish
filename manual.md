## Content

1. **Files**: input and output
    * Opening and saving files
    * Import and export (data sources, file formats)
    * Printing?
    * Inputs: project files, photographs, raster diagrams, 3D models, SfM, geo data
    * Outputs: project files
2. **Window multiplication tool** (wmux like tmux)
    * Create new window
    * Switch between windows
    * Remove the view window
    * Create sub-window of specific type (raw data: photographs, raw data: 3D meshes, raw data: diagrams, etc.)
    * Miscellaneous: hide/show, hide/show dialogue, bookmarks window, outline mode, full screen mode, preview mode, switch window and duplicate window (when using 2 screens or more)
2. **Principal tools**
    * Select tool: add and subtract from a selection set, expanding the selection set using mouse, selecting multiple entities, selecting or deselecting all geometry, selecting a single entity
    * Eraser tool: for pen and for mouse
    * Paint bucket tool: colors, textures?
5. **Drawing tools** - Geometric shapes and paths
    * Rectangles and squares
    * 3D Objects: boxes, cylinders, etc.
    * Ellipses, circles and arcs
    * Polygons
    * Bezier curves
    * Creating paths: strokes (pencil tool), Bezier pen tool
    * 3D polyline entities
    * Path operations?
2. **Modification tools** (2D and 3D transformations)
    * Move tool (translation): making copies, moving groups and components, moving precisely, moving several entities, moving a single entity 
    * Rotate tool: making rotated copies, folding along an axis of rotation, rotating precisely
    * Scale tool: scaling photographs, scaling about the geometry center, scaling components, scaling precisely, scaling uniformly
    * Offset tool
    * Using: mouse, keyboard, tool controls bar, object drop-down menu, transform dialogue (e.g. to push strokes)
2. **Camera tools**
    * Standard views: perspective mode, isometric view, current-previous view
    * Orbit tool: with mouse and with pen
    * Pan tool: panning while in other tools, panning
    * Zoom tool: change focal length with zoom tool, centering the point of view, zooming with mouse or pen, zooming in on portion of the model
    * Bookmark tool: taking the bookmark of the current scene, navigating through the taken bookmarks, opening the saved bookmark
2. **Walkthrough tools**
3. **Editing tools**
    * Undo and redo
    * Selecting objects (mouse, keyboard, find dialogue)
    * Copying, pasting and deleting objects
    * Cloning
    * Ordering objects
    * Groups: unite and split operators
    * Layers (dialogue, menu, bar)
6. **Annotation tool**
    * Creating text
    * Selecting text
    * Editing text
    * Formatting text: font size, font color, orientations
    * Tying text to an object
8. **Contruction tools**
    * Axes tool
    * Dimension tool
    * Text tool
    * Display properties: perspective grid, canvas intersections, canvas occlusions, photo opacity
13. **Entities**: raw data, user input and exported data
    * Photographs: importing, SfM; 3D bending
    * Diagrams: importing as raster, importing as vector (potrace algorithm converts to strokes)
    * 3D models: importing meshes
    * Text annotations: creating and editing, tying to locations and other entities
    * Canvases with strokes by user: opacity, color
    * 2D and 3D geometrical shapes by user: opacity, color, texture?
11. **Model settings and managers**
    * Material (texture) browser
    * Scenes manager: creating and running animation, adding a scene, updating scene
11. **Customization**
    * Preference dialogue
    * Configuration files
12. **Using command line**
    * General command line options
    * Export command line options: format options, property options
13. **Version control tool**
    * Return to previously saved version by undoing certain number of changes
15. **Common tasks**
* Appendix A: **Wacom Pen gestures list**
* Appendix B: **Glossary**
* Appendix C: **input and output file formats**
* Appendix D: **SfM from a set of images**
