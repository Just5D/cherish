**cherish** is a heterogeneous framework for the modeling, design and representation of historical structures and archaeological sites in 3D. It is designed so that to unify the currently disparate data types available (e.g. 2D images, 3D strokes entered by user, text annotations attached to 3D locations, mesh representations of buildings) and to use the strength of each to support the others.

For the data processing, rather than relying on either purely automatic approaches or human input, the framework supports speculation and reasoning in the form of both. As a result, the software is capable to take as input various raw heterogeneous data source and produce a labeled, corresponded and augmented data source that can be used in variety of applications.

## Development status

Currently converting the prototype version into alpha version, very active development. The current state of the project is not usable yet (first official relseases are planned on end of spring - beginning of summer).
